                As promised, today I'm proud to announce that Starbuzz Coffee is
                launching the Tweet Sip cup, a special Starbuzz Coffee cup that tweets
                each time you take a sip! Check out my video of our new invention.

                <p>
                Here at Starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. In fact,
                we're going further than any of our competitors and we're very close
                to announcing a revolutionary new product that links your coffee
                drinking directly to your social network. Forget "checking in"; we're
                going way beyond that, and with this new product every sip of smooth,
                aromatic, hot Starbuzz blend is going to to be shared with your social network.
                </p>
                <p>
                Sound like science fiction? It's not; I'm already testing our final prototype
                social network cup as I write this, which links you, the drinker, right to your
                favorite social networks. We've made a huge investment to make this happen and
                we've created a reusable coffee cup complete with RFID, NFC, Bluetooth, and Wifi
                (not to mention a few more things the tech folks know about, because hey, I'm just
                the coffee guy).
                </p>
                <p>
                So, keep your eyes out for this amazing new cup. And I'll be releasing a video
                teaser soon to tell you all about this new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.

                Have you ever noticed how efficient a Starbuzz Coffee house is? The lines alway move
                fast, and despite the astronomical number of different drinks any customer can order,
                we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the way you want it) and ready in seconds.
                How do we do it?
                </p>
                <p>
                To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and greatest in computer science. In fact,
                we train our staff to be one big distributed computer. The cashiers create the orders for the
                distributed computer, complete with your name and the drinks special instructions. Then our
                specialized drink makers grab the next cup and go about working on your order until it's finished.
                </p>
                <p>
                With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation any time we want. All we need to
                do is add more cashiers and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support staff you never see)
                as the customer flow grows.

                Our most unique patron of the month award goes to a customer in Poulsbo, Washington, whose daily
                morning order is a "six-splenda, no-foam, 130-degree non-fat-soy latte, with the splenda stirred
                in before the milk is added." Do we have unique customers or what?
